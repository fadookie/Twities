# Twities
Cities made from Twitter!

Please allow a minute or more once the app starts for it to download all the content, depending on your internet connection speed. It logs information about download progress to the terminal, but I don't have it displaying in the main window yet. After the first successful run, it should start much faster as it loads data from the local cache.

## Explanation of Folder Layout

 * data
	* rootUser.txt - Must contain your Twitter numeric ID. [Use a tool like this to find it](http://www.idfromuser.com/).
	* credentials.txt - Config file containing newline-delimited consumer key, consumer secret, OAuth access token, and OAuth access token secret.
 * cache - The application will store avatar images and twitter API responses here. This is generated by the application after a successful first run.
	* avatars - Cached avatar images
	* followingIds - Cached response for users that are followed by another user.
	* lookupUsers - Cached responses for users that are looked up in a batch request.

If you want to force a cache refresh on the people you are following to refresh, delete the cache/followingIds and cache/lookupUsers folders.
